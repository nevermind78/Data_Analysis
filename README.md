## Section 1: Data Analysis Essentials [Page 18](https://github.com/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Practical%20Data%20Analysis%20Using%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf)

In this section, we will learn how to speak the language of data by extracting useful and
actionable insights from data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. We'll begin with the
fundamentals of data analysis and work with the right tools to help you analyze data
effectively. After your workspace has been set up, we'll learn how to work with data using
two popular open source libraries available in Python: NumPy and pandas. This will lay
the foundation for you to understand data so that you can prepare for Section 2: Solutions for
Data Discovery.
* The section 1 includes the following topics:
  * Fundamentals of Data Analysis
  * Overview of Python and Installing Jupyter Notebook
  * Getting Started with NumPy
  * Creating Your First pandas DataFrame **TP1** : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/main?filepath=/TP1/notebooks/TP1_dataframes_features.ipynb)
  * Gathering and Loading Data in Python **TP2** : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/main?filepath=/TP2/notebooks/TP2_retrieve_sql_and_create_dataframe.ipynb)

## Section 2: Solutions for Data Discovery [Page 123](https://github.com/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Practical%20Data%20Analysis%20Using%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf)

In this section, we'll learn how to visualize data for analysis by working with time series
data. Then, we'll learn how to clean and join multiple datasets together using both SQL and
DataFrames with Python. After that, we'll go back to data visualization and learn about the
best practices when it comes to data storytelling. By the end of this section, you will
understand the foundations of descriptive analytics.
* The section 2 includes the following topics:
  * Exploratory data analysis **TP3** : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/main?filepath=/TP3/TP3.ipynb)
  * Visualization with **`matplotlib`** : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/matplotlib/main?labpath=PythonGraphes.ipynb)
 
  * Visualizing and Working with Time Series Data
  * Exploring, Cleaning, Refining, and Blending Datasets **TP4** : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nevermind78/Data_Analysis/main?filepath=/TP4/Data%20Cleaning%20with%20Python%20and%20Pandas.ipynb)
  * Understanding Joins, Relationships, and Aggregates
  * Plotting, Visualization, and Storytelling
