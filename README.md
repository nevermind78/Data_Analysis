## Section 1: Data Analysis Essentials

In this section, we will learn how to speak the language of data by extracting useful and
actionable insights from data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. We'll begin with the
fundamentals of data analysis and work with the right tools to help you analyze data
effectively. After your workspace has been set up, we'll learn how to work with data using
two popular open source libraries available in Python: NumPy and pandas. This will lay
the foundation for you to understand data so that you can prepare for Section 2: Solutions for
Data Discovery.
This section includes the following Topics:
* Fundamentals of Data Analysis
* Overview of Python and Installing Jupyter Notebook
* Getting Started with NumPy
